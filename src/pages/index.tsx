            I started this blog as a current student at the University of Windsor to share my experiences, difficulties, and all the knowledge I&apos;ve gained during my academic career. I hope you&apos;ll find something helpful or relatable here, regardless of whether you&apos;re a prospective Lancer, a current student, or just inquisitive.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-400 flex items-center gap-2">ðŸŽ“ Academic Insights</h2>
          <p className="text-lg">Studying at the University of Windsor has opened many doors for me, especially in Computer Science. A few highlights include:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            <li><strong>Collaborative learning:</strong> Working with peers on group projects helped me understand teamwork in real-world settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Hands-on experience:</strong> Courses like COMP-2140 (Language, Grammar and Translators) helped me build a parser, compiler and translator of my own.</li>
            <li><strong>Professors who care:</strong> Many instructors, like Dr. C. I. Ezeife and Dr. Jianguo Lu, go above and beyond to help students grasp core concepts.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-lg">If you&apos;re just starting, Iâ€™d recommend using <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" className="text-indigo-300 underline hover:text-indigo-200">W3Schools</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/" className="text-indigo-300 underline hover:text-indigo-200">MDN Web Docs</a> as go-to resources for coding concepts and practice.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-400 flex items-center gap-2">ðŸ§° Tools &amp; Resources That Helped Me</h2>
          <p className="text-lg">Here are some tools and websites I found extremely helpful:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            <li><strong>Notion</strong> is a lifesaver, it is the best tool for managing the hectic schedule.</li>
            <li><strong>Visual Studio Code</strong>,in my opinion, the best code editor for beginners.</li>
            <li><strong>GitHub</strong> can be used for version control but codespaces is a boon if you code on multiple devices.</li>
            <li><strong>YouTube</strong> for getting through rough patches and difficult concepts.</li>
            <li><strong>FreeCodeCamp &amp; GeeksforGeeks:</strong> for anything you want to learn related to tech.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-400 flex items-center gap-2">ðŸ’¡ Lessons is Key</h2>
          <p className="text-lg">Not everything goes perfectly and it&apos;s okay to not be okay! Hereâ€™s what I learned from some of my own mistakes:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            <li><strong>Just focus on the basics:</strong> I once lost hours debugging something that was clearly explained in the docs. Always read the docs first.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid delaying important tasks:</strong> This is a dear request to everyone, start planning and stop procrastinating. I lost 10% of my grade because I thought that i can finish the assignment an hour before the deadline.</li>
            <li><strong>Asking for help isn&apos;t a sign of weakness:</strong> Professors and TAs are there to help, but you have to reach out. Donâ€™t keep strugglingâ€”be smart and take advice from those who have already done what youâ€™re finding hard.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-400 flex items-center gap-2">ðŸ“Œ A Piece of Advice</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            <li><strong>Start pursuing your plans:</strong> Even 30 minutes a day on a tough topic adds up. Just keep moving ahead and don&apos;t look back.</li>
            <li><strong>Spend more time with like-minded people:</strong> Talk, spend time or just be close to people who are like you and have similar goals. Because they can be the push in your low times when you don&apos;t feel like doing anything.</li>
            <li><strong>Use campus resources:</strong> The Leddy Library, Writing Support Desk, and Career Services are fantastic and should be utilised for research papers, assignments, or any help you need.</li>
            <li><strong>Balance is crucial:</strong> Life doesn&apos;t always have to be hard and heavy. Take some time offâ€”have fun, go on a trip with friends, play sports. Give some time to your mental well-being as well.</li>
          </ul>
